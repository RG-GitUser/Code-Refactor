# Code-Refactor

## Description

In this project, I have made various changes to the code in html as well as the css file using semantic elements. Semantic element changes are used to enhance the accessibility for the users experience (UX). Accessibility allows the user to easily understand what the webpage is displaying, specifically when the user has a device equipt to read aloud.

## Installation

1. From the "Code-Refactor" repository (https://github.com/RG-GitUser/Code-Refactor) select the "Code" dropdown.
2. Using the "Code" dropdown, click on "SSH".
3. On the "SSH" tab, select the "copy" button next to  the address.
4. Next, open your git bash terminal (or for mac users, homebrew)
5. Use the command "git clone" and "insert coppied SSH key here" then press enter. 
6. Enter the "cd "enter path here" " command to navigate to the correct directory. 
7. You now have the repository cloned to your system! To verify, the command "ls" to view the items listed inside of the repository. 

## Usage

We can review the code to identify changes made for accessibility purposes. 

Here you can see examples of semantic elements used to refine the webpage for accessibility;
